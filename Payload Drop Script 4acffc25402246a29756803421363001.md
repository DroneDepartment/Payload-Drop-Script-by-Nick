Current Payload Drop script:

[auto5.lua](Payload%20Drop%20Script%204acffc25402246a29756803421363001/auto5.lua)

Implements payload drop logic, Arduino feedback, and SmartRTL. Payload drop triggered by DO_SEND_SCRIPT_MESSAGE message before drop waypoint. SmartRTL currently triggered by sending an RC value, however it would be optimal to be triggered by a MavLink message. The PixHawk connects to Arduino through TELEM1 serial port.
